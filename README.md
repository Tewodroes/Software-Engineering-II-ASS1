        1 - A shopping cart Android App
     ------------------------------------
     In this app showing use of MVC Pattern to create a very basic Shopping cart. Creating very basic Controller Class and defined in          application context and I use this Controller Class as a Global class. If any View(Activity) required values then view should              call controller and then controller will call appropriate Model and provide value to view.
     Models can also communicate with each others to exchange values.
     
     
      2 - Client-Server implementation
    -------------------------------------
    
   In this implementation I try to show Client- server archetictural design patter in socket-programming of java.
   Sockets provide the communication mechanism between two computers using TCP. TCP is a two-way communication protocol.
   Thejava.net.Socket class represents the socket between the client and the server, and the java.net.ServerSocket class provides            mechanism for the server application to listen to clients and establish connections with them.
